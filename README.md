# About

The objective of this project is to exhibit a sneakers website wherein users can browse different shoes from different brands. but the catch is, it's for browsing purposes only as the website doesn't involve in any business per se. Future plans include to add 3D models of the shoes, add reaction button on items, and maybe continue as a fully developed e-commerce web app.
